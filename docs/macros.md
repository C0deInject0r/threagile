| Macros                | Description            |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| `add-build-pipeline`  | Add Build Pipeline     |
| `add-vault`           | Add Vault              |
| `pretty-print`        | Pretty Print           |
| `remove-unused-tags`  | Remove Unused Tags     |
| `seed-risk-tracking`  | Seed Risk Tracking     |
| `seed-tags`           | Seed Tags              |

Macros act like a small mini program which will modify your model file. Currently it has limited support and has not been tested with [includes](./includes.md)
